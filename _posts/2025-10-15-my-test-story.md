Title: The Angel's Algorithm

## Part I — The Killings

No one knew when *Mortis.me* first appeared.
Rumors said it emerged from a string of encrypted dark-web forums — anonymous, faceless, hidden between layers of code and menace.

At first, it was just a curiosity. A site that claimed it could tell you **when** and **how** you’d die. Enter your name. Upload a photo. Wait for the timer to process.

Most people laughed it off.

Until it started being right.

Within two weeks, the city had its first “prediction come true.” A college student, Nisha Kapoor, reportedly entered her details for fun with her friends one Friday night. The site told her she’d die at 3:47 a.m. in her apartment bathroom. Heart failure.

When the police arrived, they found her collapsed near the sink. No forced entry. No drugs. Just silence — and a faint scent of antiseptic, as though someone had wiped the room clean.

Two days later, another: a delivery driver on the outskirts of the city, predicted to die in a “vehicular accident” at dawn. He was found in his locked van — ignition off, no sign of impact. Dead at dawn, the same minute the site had promised.

The media named the killer *The Angel of Death*.

Fear spread faster than reason. People stopped talking to neighbors, unplugged smart devices, shut laptop lids like they were cursed. Yet, every few nights, someone new appeared on the site’s feed: a blurred photograph, a countdown clock, a clinical prediction.

The city’s hum turned paranoid. News tickers, talk shows, and hashtags — all whispering the same thing:

> The Angel knows your time.

## Part II — Detective’s Case Report

**Case File:** #0047–C / “Mortis”
**Lead Investigator:** Detective Arjun Mehta, Cyber Forensics Division
**Status:** Active / Unsolved
**Classification:** High priority threat, psychological serial homicide

### Preliminary Overview

Between February – June, 11 confirmed victims across the city. Each had previously visited a dark-web site accessible only via Tor networks. Each death corresponded exactly to a time, location, and cause predicted by the site.

Victims ranged from age 19 – 52. No connection between them — differing occupations, economic classes, social circles. Each death scene was clinically sterile. No fingerprints. No DNA. No sign of struggle.

One common anomaly: traces of isopropyl cleaning agent and salt residue found in four of the locations.

### Scene Observations

**Case #7 — Victim: Dr. R. Sharma**
Date of prediction: May 8, 11:26 p.m.
Cause listed: Pulmonary failure, domestic residence.

At 11:27 p.m., neighbors reported a power fluctuation. When police arrived, the doctor was found in his home office, collapsed beside his desk, laptop screen frozen on the Mortis homepage.

Air smelled faintly metallic, as though from overheated electronics. No forced entry. Smart lock logs showed “manual override,” but records were later found wiped clean.

Forensic techs recovered a micro-residue pattern on the desk’s edge — consistent with rubber gloves coated in ethanol.

**Observation:** The killer remained long enough to stage the scene, yet left no biological trace. Calculated. Detached.

**Case #9 — Victim: A. Singh**
Date of prediction: May 22, 3:02 a.m.
Cause listed: Asphyxiation, vehicular enclosure.

Victim found seated in driver’s seat of his own vehicle, locked from inside. No carbon-monoxide traces, no blunt trauma. Engine off. Digital dash camera card missing.

A faint imprint of adhesive on the inner rear-view mirror — likely where a miniature camera had been placed. Nearby CCTV feeds revealed a van passing twice around 2:55 a.m., lights off. License plate registered to a decommissioned government vehicle.

**Observation:** The killer uses remote surveillance. Tracks victims in real-time. Waits until the exact prediction moment before ensuring fatality through controlled environmental manipulation (likely oxygen displacement or chemical induction).

### Digital Forensics

Server traces point to a layered proxy chain bouncing between Romania, Estonia, and an unlisted subnet associated with obsolete military tech infrastructure. Website architecture shows familiarity with quantum-resistant encryption — not possible with publicly available tools.

The killer isn’t merely a hacker. He’s a systems architect.

Recovered script snippets reveal a naming convention for victims — hashed identifiers that, when decrypted, spell Latin words for virtues: *spes* (hope), *fides* (faith), *caritas* (charity). A macabre irony — victims labeled as virtues by someone who believes he’s Heaven’s hand.

### Psychological Profile

Subject self-identifies as *“The Angel of Death.”* Refers to killings as executions, not murders. Believes he fulfills divine prophecy through algorithmic precision — “I bring order where chaos rules mortality.”

Likely displays high cognitive empathy, low emotional empathy. Understands human fear but feels none of it. Organized offender, exhibiting both narcissistic and messianic traits. Prior exposure to military-grade cybersecurity or intelligence networks likely. No ransom, no communication except encoded messages hidden within the website source code.

### The Discovery

Three weeks ago, we traced a dormant packet signature buried in Mortis’s CSS files — a personal taunt left behind in base64 code. Decoded, it read:

> Even you will know your time, Detective.

That night, I accessed the site through a secured sandbox environment to confirm. The interface had changed — simplified. One empty field. A blinking cursor.

*Enter your name.*

For a moment, I thought to close the terminal. Instead, I typed **A. Mehta**. Processing bar. Screen flickered. Then the words appeared, in monochrome text:

> Time: 02:17 a.m.
> Date: 14 Oct 2025
> Cause: Cardiac arrest
> Location: Office of Cyber Forensics Division

I laughed then — the mechanical reflex of disbelief. Logged the evidence, shut the system, documented every step.

Still, for the past week, I’ve heard faint electronic ticks in the walls. My office lights blink at odd intervals. Last night, my smart lock cycled open twice, though no one entered.

### Addendum — October 14, 2025

Time now: 02:11 a.m. Power fluctuations detected across the building. Backup generator online. System logs show unauthorized process running under my credentials. Attempting to trace—

[Recording terminates]

The next morning, colleagues found Detective Arjun Mehta at his desk, slumped forward, monitor still glowing with lines of code that read only one phrase:

> The Angel completes his work.
